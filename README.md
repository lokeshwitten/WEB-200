What are QR codes? 
QR codes or Quick Response codes are two-dimensional barcodes that a smartphone or barcode scanner can scan. 
Why QR codes?
QR codes can be used to store a large amount of data compared to the regular bar codes. QR code works fine even if it's slightly tampered. This QR codes are a preferred way of information exhange and is used widely from displaying UPI IDs to Hotel Menus

Types of QR codes
Static QR codes are used when the encoded information is not expected to change. Once generated, the information cannot be updated or modified. This type of QR code is often used for simple tasks like sharing a website address, contact information, or a Wi-Fi password.
Dynamic QR codes, on the other hand, offer more flexibility as the data they store can be updated or changed without altering the code’s appearance. These codes contain a unique URL, which points to a server where the information is stored. When scanned, the dynamic QR code redirects the user to the URL, allowing them to access the most current information. It also provides a ripe opportunity for scammers to manipulate legitimate QR codes by changing their source to a malicious one.
One of the most popular attacks with QR codes is Quishing 
What is Quishing?
 A quishing attack begins with a cybercriminal creating QR codes that lead to either a fake login page, where they collect the credentials of their victims, or to a downloadable virus or malware, which begins downloading immediately after the code is scanned. These codes can then be planted into emails as images or within attachments, but they can also be displayed in public places where victims are likely to scan them. After scanning the QR code, they are asked to provide sensitive information like login credentials or bank details or to download malicious software or apps – the download can also happen automatically right after scanning the code, further infecting their device.
Example:
A recent example of quishing involved using legitimate employee accounts, which were previously compromised, to gain access to Microsoft credentials. Attackers sent emails claiming to contain a voicemail from the account holder, which could only be heard by scanning the QR code. Upon scanning this code, employees were then directed to a realistic-looking Microsoft login page, where they unknowingly provided their credentials to the attackers.
